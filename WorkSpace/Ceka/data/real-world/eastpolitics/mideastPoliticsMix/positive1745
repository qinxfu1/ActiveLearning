    This can be turned around.  The Austrians who should feel guilty about
 their actions during WWII, but don't, justify their anti-semetism by making
 every Israeli action into an atrocity.  The Austrians, Germans and other
 Europeans have extensive trading relations with the Arab block; being 
 pro-Arab is good for business.  I don't think that ethics has a thing to
 do about it.
