While one may question the motives of the Arabs who sold land to Jews,
often while publicly criticizing the sale of land to Jews, it was the
Jews and not the Arabs who were taken advantage of, as the prices the
Jews paid for barren land was many times the price fertile land was
being sold for in the United States at the same time.
