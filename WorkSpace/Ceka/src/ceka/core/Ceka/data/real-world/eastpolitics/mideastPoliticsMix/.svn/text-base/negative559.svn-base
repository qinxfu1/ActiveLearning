Wow, I hadn't realized how VENOMOUS this was getting!  Be careful here...the
problem isn't the rich but the values and the systems that make the rich
rich.  Things are designed in such a way that in order to go with the system
and make money, everything ELSE we care about goes to shit.  I have to
constantly remind myself that the goal of human society is not to make
money.  Money doesn't make us happy; it just prevents certain things making
us more unhappy.

Therefore, don't shoot the rich.  Shoot the conservatives!
