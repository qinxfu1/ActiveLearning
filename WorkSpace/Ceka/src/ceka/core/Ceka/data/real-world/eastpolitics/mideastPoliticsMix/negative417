          Sometimes a god-believer will maintain that atheism is itself 
       a religion.  Many postings to this group have answered that well.  
       Here's another way to answer the assertion: 
          Suppose that I DON'T believe that broken mirrors or black cats 
       bring bad luck.  Does that mean that I have a superstition?
