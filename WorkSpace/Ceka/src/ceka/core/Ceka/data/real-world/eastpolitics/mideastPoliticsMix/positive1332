@ o Dr Namaki also stated that before the revolution only
@   254f children received vaccinations to protect them
@   from various deseases but this figure reached 93at
@   the end of 1371.
      
Something funny happens to the percent sign. In paragraph
above, the vaccination rate went from 25 percent to 93 percent.
