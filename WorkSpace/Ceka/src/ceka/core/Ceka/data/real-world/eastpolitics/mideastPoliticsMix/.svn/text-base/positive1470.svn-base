My recollection of History/Documentary books is slitely different.
It is my understanding that Croats were allies of Germany during
WWII, while Serbs had sided with Russia.  As a result Serbs did
take a beating from Croats (NOT Bosnian Moslems) while Germany
had the upper hand.

Even today, Russians consider/call Serbs as their Slovac brothers.
This is one of the issues involved in the U.N.'s lack of active
intervention against Serbs.

As for the Bosnian Moslems, I have not heard of any alliance with
Germany or Russia in recent history.  Therefore, I am curious
if they did or were able to treat other parties in this conflict
with same brutallity (as they are getting it today) in the past
history.
